COMMENTS:  Normal dilute Russell's viper venom screening time (DRVVT screen ratio) provides no evidence of a lupus anticoagulant (LAC) by this methodology.      Mixing study of the borderline prolonged activated partial thromboplastin screening time (APTT) using a moderately LAC-responsive APTT reagent demonstrated no evidence of inhibition.

Further studies performed to investigate the prolonged APTT demonstrated normal activity levels of factors VIII, IX, XI and XII.  The borderline prolonged APTT may be due to a (clinically insignificant) deficiency of prekallikrein or high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), or the presence of an anticoagulant drug in the submitted sample that becomes undetectable after 1:1 dilution in the APTT mixing study.

COMMENTS:  Prolonged thrombin time and normal reptilase time are consistent with the patient's documented anticoagulation with heparin, as is the result of the mixing study of the prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT).  A heparin anti-Xa assay was performed to quantify the heparin level to aid in interpretation of the lupus anticoagulant test results and demonstrated a heparin anti-Xa activity of 0.32 IU/mL.  Evaluation for a lupus anticoagulant using this APTT reagent is therefore precluded by the presence of anticoagulation (heparin) effects, since it does not contain a heparin neutralizer.      Additional testing for a lupus anticoagulant was performed using the Staclot-LA methodology, which contains a highly LAC-responsive APTT reagent and a heparin neutralizer.  Accurate results can be expected in samples containing up to 1.00 U/mL of heparin.  Addition of hexagonal phase phospholipid significantly shortened the clotting time (elevated Staclot delta).  In the context of the other laboratory data, this is suggestive of the presence of a lupus anticoagulant (LAC) by the APTT methodology, as long as other anticoagulation effects (e.g. direct thrombin inhibitors) and interfering substances can be excluded.  Repeat testing remote from anticoagulation should be considered to confirm or exclude the presence of a lupus anticoagulant, if appropriate.

COMMENTS:  Normal dilute Russell's viper venom screening time (DRVVT screen ratio) and shortened activated partial thromboplastin screening time (APTT) provide no evidence of a lupus anticoagulant by these two methodologies, within limitations of assay responsiveness.      Elevated fibrin D-dimer and SFMC (soluble fibrin monomer complexes) levels are indicative of increased intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis (ICF), as can occur in association with recent bleeding, surgery or thromboembolism, hypercoagulable or inflammatory or hyperfibrinolytic states, liver disease, or clinical ICF/DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), among other conditions.  Clinical correlation is suggested.      Prolonged thrombin and reptilase times are explained by the decreased Clauss fibrinogen level.  The normal prothrombin time (PT)-derived fibrinogen level and decreased Clauss fibrinogen/ PT-derived fibrinogen ratio of 0.2 (published normal range > 0.7) are consistent with a dysfibrinogenemia, either acquired (e.g. liver disease) or congenital.  Clinical correlation is recommended.      Mildly prolonged prothrombin time (PT) may reflect a coagulation factor deficiency state (e.g. early or recent warfarin anticoagulation, vitamin K deficiency, liver disease, consumptive coagulopathy, congenital deficiency), or may be due to inhibition by an anticoagulant drug (e.g. direct factor Xa inhibitor), among other possibilities.  Clinical correlation is recommended. If clinically indicated, for further evaluation of the prolonged PT, consider measurement of activity levels of factors II, V, VII and X.     "

Prolonged thrombin time and normal reptilase time are suggestive of a heparin or direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) effect, as is the result of the mixing study of the prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT).  NOTE:  Presence of heparin/DTI (dabigatran, argatroban, bivalirudin) precludes interpretation of testing for a lupus anticoagulant with this APTT assay system, which does not use a heparin neutralizer.  Repeat APTT testing locally (remote from heparin/DTI) or resubmission of a fresh sample for repeat testing (remote from heparin/DTI) should be considered, if appropriate.      Additional testing for a lupus anticoagulant was performed using the Staclot-LA methodology, which contains a highly LAC-responsive APTT reagent and a heparin neutralizer.  Addition of hexagonal phase phospholipid did not significantly shorten the clotting time (normal Staclot Delta), providing no evidence of a lupus anticoagulant by the APTT methodology.      The patient's plasma inhibited the assay system for measurement of the activity level of coagulation factor VIII, thereby precluding precise quantification.  However, upon serial dilutions of the patient's plasma, the factor VIII activity progressively increased and is at least normal.

Mixing study of the prolonged activated partial thromboplastin screening time (APTT) did not demonstrate inhibition, providing no definite evidence of a lupus anticoagulant by this APTT methodology, which uses a moderately LAC-responsive APTT reagent.  There was insufficient specimen volume available for additional APTT-based lupus anticoagulant testing with the hexagonal phase phospholipid neutralization test (Staclot-LA), which contains a highly LAC-responsive APTT reagent and a heparin neutralizer.  If desired, consider resubmission of a fresh specimen (remote from anticoagulation) for additional APTT-based lupus anticoagulant testing using the Staclot-LA methodology (test code: STACL).  Measurement of activity levels of factors VIII, IX, XI and XII may also be considered for further evaluation of the prolonged APTT.      The thrombin time was mildly prolonged, but there was insufficient specimen volume available for reptilase time testing to exclude the presence of heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) in the submitted sample.  Other causes of prolonged thrombin time apart from heparin/ DTI effects include hypo- and/ or dysfibrinogenemia, abnormal fibrin polymerization (e.g. due to a monoclonal protein or elevated fibrin degradation products) or an in vitro artifact due to hypo-albuminemia.

Further studies performed to investigate the cause of the prolonged APTT demonstrated normal activity levels of factors VIII, IX, XI and XII.  The mildly prolonged APTT may be due to a (clinically insignificant) deficiency of prekallikrein or high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), or the presence of an anticoagulant drug in the submitted sample that becomes undetectable after 1:1 dilution in the APTT mixing study.  Clinical correlation is suggested.      Normal dilute Russell's viper venom screening time (DRVVT screen ratio) provides no evidence of a lupus anticoagulant by this methodology.     "

COMMENTS:  Mixing study of the prolonged dilute Russell's viper venom screening time (DRVVT screen ratio) demonstrated inhibition (elevated DRVVT mix ratio), and additional phospholipid significantly shortened the clotting time (elevated DRVVT confirm ratio), consistent with the presence of a lupus anticoagulant by the DRVVT methodology, as long as anticoagulation effects can be excluded.      Mixing study of the prolonged activated partial thromboplastin screening time (APTT) demonstrated inhibition, and additional phospholipid in the platelet neutralization procedure (PNP) significantly shortened the clotting time, consistent with the presence of a lupus anticoagulant by the APTT methodology, provided anticoagulation effects and other interfering substances can be excluded.      Normal thrombin time provides no evidence of unfractionated heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor in the submitted sample.      Prolonged prothrombin time (PT) demonstrated inhibition in a 1:1 mixing study with pooled normal plasma.  Further studies performed to investigate the prolonged PT demonstrated normal activity levels of factors II, V, VII and X.  In the context of the available laboratory data, the prolonged and inhibited PT most likely reflects the presence of an anticoagulant drug (e.g. direct factor Xa inhibitor) and/ or a non-specific coagulation inhibitor (e.g. lupus anticoagulant or monoclonal protein) in the submitted sample. Clinical correlation is recommended.     "
